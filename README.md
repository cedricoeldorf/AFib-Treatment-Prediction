# DONE:
- Data merge
- Demographics Inclusion



# TO DO:
- Preprocessing options:
	- drop unimportant leads in order to minimize resource use while training
	- dimensionality reduction 
		- check pca,check autoencoder, (pca on demographics done) 
	- Daniel: Signal preprocessing 
- Modeling (lay off for now)


# Current Results
PCA on demographic data in combination with ECG: Conv net predicts everything as 0
Could either be class imbalance or I dont know
